Python Execution Process
Source Code to Bytecode:

Python source code (.py files) is converted into an intermediate form called bytecode (.pyc files) by the Python compiler.
This bytecode is a low-level, platform-independent representation of your code.
Bytecode to Machine Code:

The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) executes the bytecode.
PVM interprets the bytecode line by line and converts it into machine code for execution.
Python Virtual Machine (PVM):

It is a part of the Python runtime environment.
Acts as an interpreter to execute bytecode, handling memory management, error handling, etc.


Why Python is Called an Interpreted Language

Python doesn't directly convert code into machine code like compiled languages (e.g., C++).
Instead, PVM interprets the bytecode at runtime, making it an interpreted language.

Mutable Objects
Definition: Objects whose content or state can be modified after creation.

-- List Set Dictionary Array


immuatble 
Definition: Objects whose content or state cannot be modified after creation.
-- Integres float boolean string 

name = "ansh"  # "ansh" is stored in memory, and `name` refers to it.
print(name)    # Output: "ansh"

name = "mehtra"  # A new string "mehtra" is created in memory, and `name` now refers to this new string.
